This is a work-in-progress general purpose library for Unity based around custom coroutines and timers. I started developing it as a way to learn and improve my skills as a game developer, but I'm documenting it in case anyone else becomes interested in using it.

The goal for this library is to be able to chain and orchestrate coroutines in a organic way and provide ways to quickly implement some stuff such as pooling, event systems, UI actions and more.
